== Overview

Data is fetched by a Trace-X instance using Digital Twin Registry (DTR), Item Relationship Service (IRS) and Trace-X Consumer EDC. As an assumption data is already provided to the Catena-X network using the EDC since Trace-X is not a Data Provider and therefore no possibility for data provisioning with Trace-X.
As standard for digital twins the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) standard is used. For fetching data with Trace-X, Digital Twin Registry and IRS are set to be used in the process. Data should represent parts, supplier and customer parts, parts tree / parts relations.
